# Terraform

This repo handles different Terrafom providers projects.


## Getting started

The aim of this repo is to show different integrations of Terraform to deploy environments in different Providers( Openstack, AWS...)

The repo is divided in different folder based on the nature of the provider.

### Terraform commands to run the configuration

- `terraform plan` : It shows a plan with the tasks that will be done.
- `terraform apply` : Apply the changes in the provider
- `terraform destroy` : Destroy the changes previously applied
